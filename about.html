			<p id="title">Hi I'm Jessica</p>
			<p> 
				Welcome to my website! I'm Jessica, a 3rd year at Brown University pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. Currently, I'm a full time student as well as a <a target="_blank" href="http://cs.brown.edu/degrees/undergrad/jobs/consult/">Linux Lab Consultant</a> and Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for <a target="_blank" href=http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2014>Programming Languages</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Recently I've done a lot of work with web dev and frontend UI design(including creating this website from scratch!). I also have experience in iOS programming and functional programming. I really like designing software that helps connect people to people. Feel free to check out my <a href="http://jessliang.tumblr.com">design blog</a> where I write my thoughts about different apps and websites. Other than frontend development, I also have a strong interest in Programming Languages. I'd love to get the opportunity to explore that path in the future too!
			</p>
			<p>
				For the last two summers I've worked at Facebook. In 2013 I was part of Facebook's first class of Facebook University interns. At FBU I learned iOS development and worked with a FTE mentor and a group of 3 other interns to create an an iOS application. This last summer, I joined the Timeline Team to work on web development. I worked on a new feature for Timeline that has not been shipped publicly yet, and also on a redesign of the about unit side unit on Timeline. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One of my passions is mentoring and teaching others. Other than being a teaching assistant, I'm also a <a target="_blank" href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/orgs/wics/">WiCS</a> mentor, and a Organizer of  <a target="_blank" href="http://hackatbrown.org">Hack@Brown</a>, Brown's annual Hackathon. I love mentoring underclassmen and sharing the things that I've learned over these last few years. Helping organize Hack@Brown is one of the ways I can do this at a larger scale. Hack@Brown's mission is to <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@molllified/redesigning-the-hackathon-experience-for-beginners-5220c508e96f">redesign the hackathon experience for beginners</a> to be a place for people to come learn skills they wouldn't normally learn in university.
